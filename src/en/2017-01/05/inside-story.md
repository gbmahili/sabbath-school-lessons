<h1>“Lord, I Can’t Find You. Please Find Me”: Part 1</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Hannele tore open her cousin’s letter and began reading. “I’ve given my life to Jesus,” her cousin wrote. <em>What does that mean?</em> Hannele wondered. Hannele had sometimes attended Sunday School, but she’d never heard of
someone giving his or her life to Jesus.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Hannele longed for a similar experience with God but wasn’t sure how to have it. She attended several different churches and joined youth activities, but she didn’t find what her cousin had described. Hannele bought a Bible and read it through; she did things that she thought Christians did, but still she felt spiritually hungry.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">After finishing her university schooling, Hannele moved to Helsinki, Finland’s capital city. There she met her future husband. Hannele invited him to attend church with her, hoping that he would find God and then show her how to find Him too. But that didn’t work.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The couple had children, and life became busy. Hannele had everything she wanted—except God. As she continued visiting churches, she prayed, “Lord, I can’t find You. Please find me.”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Hannele’s teenage daughter decided to study in Australia for a year. Worried, Hannele prayed that her daughter would find a good family to live with—and she did. “They were wonderful!” Hannele said later. “Greg, the father, helped us set up our computer, so we could instant message one another. As we chatted, I got to know Greg and told him of my search for God. He told me that he had drifted away from his childhood church, but he suggested that I read his favorite book, <em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/130.0">The Desire of Ages</a>.</em> I found the book on the Internet and read it. It changed my life! I read it again, this time comparing it with my Bible. At last, I sensed that I was finding answers to my questions and a closer walk with God.”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Greg’s father was a former missionary who answered Hannele’s questions about God. He told her that he was a Seventh-day Adventist, but she had never heard of such a group. He explained that Adventists keep the Bible Sabbath and look forward to Jesus’ return. Hannele’s husband looked the church up on the Internet, and Hannele was reassured by what she read.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Greg told Hannele about an Adventist television station available on the Internet. She watched several programs and rejoiced to find that her life was changing for the better.</p>
